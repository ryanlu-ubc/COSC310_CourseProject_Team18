# **AUTOMATED HOTEL RESERVATION AGENT**

## *PROJECT DESCRIPTION*

The objective of this project was to practice project management skills and familiarize the software development process by creating an interactive conversation agent. The project I have chosen involves the chatbot taking on the role of a hotel reservation receptionist. The agent will lead the client to a successful reservation through a series of inquiries regarding room choice. The project will be broken down into 6 phases and will be proactively managed using project management tools such as JIRA.

## *SDLC SELECTION*
### The Waterfall Methodology 

The Waterfall technique is a sequential strategy with specific objectives for each development phase. Despite being aware of the limitations of The Waterfall Model such as having to finish the previous step before moving to the next phase, I found it the best option due to the following reasons: 

1. Since there is a lack of communication among team members within my group, I found it more efficient by following the Waterfall approach because it strives to create detailed documentation before any of the subsequent stages begin.  
2. This model is simple and easy to understand and use. Because of the model's rigidity, it is simple to manage — each step has clear deliverables and a review mechanism. 



## *SDLC PHASES*

1. Requirement Analysis
    - Perform research on the responsibilities of a front desk receptionist (specifically, duties related to making reservations)
    - Study the systematic dialogues of a hotel receptionist (sentences generated from the chatbot must appear respectful and professional)
    - Identify the potential guest requests and produce the corresponding response. 


2. Planning
    - Evaluate the terms of the assignment 
    - Define the scope and purpose of the program
    - Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) 
    -  Draw up a Gantt chart to show the timeline and the dependencies of each task 

3. Architectual Design
    - Select a software development methodology 
    - Specify programming language and overall design
    - Identify the methods(functions) used to develop the program

4. Code Development
    - Code development (Build the program according to the design documents and outlined specifications)
    - Write documentation for the project

5. Testing
    - Ensure the program can run successfully in the console
    - Carry out a complete dialogue of 30 turns between the bot and the guest
    - Identify the limitations of the program, through simulating at least 2 scenarios where the bot is incapable of handling the guest’s request. 


9. Presentation
    - Display a live demonstration of the program and highlight any key features, or any known limitations.
    - Provide a brief overview of each teammate’s task assignments
    - Present the project management graph on GitHub
    - Highlight the use of project management tools

## *Work Breakdown Structure*

The WBS chart below decomposes phases need to be done to accomplish the project. Aside from phases, there is also detailed information demonstrating which task is assigned to whom and an estimated time of the duration of each task should be taken. This WBS is divided into six phases, including: Requirement Analysis, Planning, Architectual Design, Code Development, Testing and Presentation. Each phase has its own corresponding deliverables that are to be completed.

The Gantt chart above shows all major tasks that need to be completed. Every assignment was evaluated in terms of urgency and was given appropriate timelines for completion. As shown on the chart, most tasks depend on the completion of tasks classified in the previous phase.

## *Limitations*

There are several limitations in this version of the reservation agent. These limitations include: 
- The program is unable to handle synonyms.  
- The program cannot understand conversations if the user makes spelling mistakes in keywords. 
- The program understands limited user inputs which makes dialogues inflexible and repetitive. 
- The program does not have a GUI.  
- The dialogue will only be finished if user input includes “thank you”.
